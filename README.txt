Collaboration of Drew Bozarth and Thomas Gooding on assignment.
Drew worked on Simulation, game iteration within game modes
Thomas worked on GameStart, board transcribing on game modes (Classic, mirror, Doughnut)
We worked together on main, on debugging, and on the general planning for our solution and the problem solving that happened outside of writing code
LearningLad, C Program to generate random numbers within a range of values: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZaZxHzRn-AY
Cplusplus.com, sleep_for command to pause the console output for printing generations with a set pause between generations https://www.cplusplus.com/reference/thread/this_thread/sleep_for/

** note ** we did insert the check for if the simulation is oscilating :)

Instructions:
Start compsci docker container with "start compsci"
Attach compsci docker container with "attach compsci"
Change directory into where ever the files are "cd ____"
Check to make sure the files are there with "ls"
Enter "make all" to compile all of the files within the directory
Run the output file with "./_____.out"
Once completed, enter "make realclean" to remove all unnecessary files from the directory before submitting
